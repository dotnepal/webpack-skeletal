### Feature
This skeletal contains the following libraries bundled together

- Bootstrap (Sass) based
- Typescript
- Jquery
- Webpack

### How to use it?
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/samundra/webpack-skeletal.git
$ cd webpack-skeletal
$ npm install
```

### Run webpack to build assets
```bash
$ cd webpack-skeletal
$ node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

### Cleanup Build folder
 ```bash
 $ cd webpack-skeletal
 $ ./cleanup.sh
 ```
 
### TODO
- add live-reload
- better code-splitting (https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)
- add JsX
